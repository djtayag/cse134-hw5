                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Darryl, a 4th year undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. I am planning on graduating in June 2023.
                        I am currently working at Innovive as an Engineering Intern.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                        Some things that I enjoy doing in my free time are spending time with friends and family, chilling with my dog Yogi, playing video games, 
                        watching basketball, and going out to eat!
                    </p>
